Ansible Oracle DB Upgrade Role
=========

## Notice
As of Jun 10, 2021 this repository has been archived and will no longer be developed or monitored.


This role will upgrade an Oracle database.  The role is is divided into 3 sections that should be run in this order:

1. `pre_upgrade.yml` (no downtime if database is in archivelog mode)
 - run 24 hrs before planned database upgrade
 - runs pre-upgrade oracle script, performs full (level 0) backup, runs fixup scripts.

2. `upgrade.yml` (Downtime is required!)
 - performs incremental (level 1) backup, enables flashback database and creates guaranteed restore point.  Runs manual database upgrade.  Takes another full backup after upgrade is complete.

3. `upgrade_final.yml` (no downtime if database is in archivelog mode)
 - run 7 days after upgrade to finalize
 - deletes guaranteed restore point before setting database compatibility parameter.  Takes full backup (level 0).

Role Variables
--------------

Expected Variables:
from playbook:
 db_name: name of database to be upgraded

Database must be defined in dict variable "database_parameters".  All items listed are required in this role.

```yaml
database_parameters:
  <db_name>:
    db_version: # 12.1.0.2, 11.2.0.4
    sga_target: 1G
    pga_aggregate_target: 1G
    redolog_size_mb: 75
    db_recovery_file_dest_size: #size of fra, 10G
    log_mode: # archivelog, noarchivelog
```

defaults/main.yml

```yaml
  pre_upgrade: false    # set to true to run pre-upgrade tasks
  upgrade: false        # set to true to upgrade database
  upgrade_final: false  # set to true to run final upgrade tasks
```

vars/main.yml

```yaml
oracle_version: version to upgrade to (12.1.0.2)
oracle_home: new oracle home
env: environment variables to set for upgraded database

oracle_version_old: current version of the database (11.2.0.4)
oracle_home_old: current oracle home
env_old:  environment variables for current database (before upgrade)
```

Example Playbook
----------------

```yaml
    - hosts: oracle
      become: true
      become_user: oracle
      vars:
        db_name: test

      roles:
        - role: db-upgrade
```

### Optional Tags

To skip these optional tags use `--skip-tags` when running the playbook.  For example, if you do not want to run RMAN backups before or during the upgrade you would execute these commands:

```
# Pre-Upgrade checks without backups
ansible-playbook 12c_1_pre_upgrade.yml -i <path_to_inventory> --extra-vars="hosts=<hostname>" --skip-tags="pre_upgrade_backup"

# Upgrade database, do not backup database.
ansible-playbook 12c_2_upgrade.yml -i <path_to_inventory> --extra-vars="hosts=<hostname>" --skip-tags="backup"

# Post-Upgrade tasks, do not backup database.
ansible-playbook 12c_3_upgrade_final.yml -i <path_to_inventory> --extra-vars="hosts=<hostname>" --skip-tags="final_upgrade_backup"
```

`pre_upgrade_backup` - Level 0 backup that runs during pre-upgrade checks.  If this is skipped do not run subsequent Level 1 backups.

`archivelog` - Run during pre-upgrade playbook.  Shuts down database and enables archivelog and flashback database.

`backup` - Level 1 backup that runs before database upgrade.

`flashback` - Run during upgrade playbook.  Enables Flashback database and creates a guaranteed restore point.

`final_upgrade_backup` - Level 0 backup that runs during final upgrade tasks.
